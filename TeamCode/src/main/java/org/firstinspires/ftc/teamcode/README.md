## TeamCode Module

Welcome!

This module, TeamCode, is the place where you will write/paste the code for your team's
robot controller App. This module is currently empty (a clean slate) but the
process for adding OpModes is straightforward.

## Creating your own OpModes

The easiest way to create your own OpMode is to copy a Sample OpMode and make it your own.

Sample opmodes exist in the FtcRobotController module.
To locate these samples, find the FtcRobotController module in the "Project/Android" tab.

Expand the following tree elements:
FtcRobotController/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller/external/samples

We ( 19419 & 22232 ) already coded the basic code as you can see under the slate. DO NOT
CHANGE THEM EXCEPT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING.


### Coding Tips

Each OpMode sample class begins with several lines of code like the ones shown below:

```
 @TeleOp(name="Template: Linear OpMode", group="Linear Opmode")
 @Disabled
```

The name that will appear on the driver station's "opmode list" is defined by the code:
``name="Template: Linear OpMode"``
You can change what appears between the quotes to better describe your opmode.
The "group=" portion of the code can be used to help organize your list of OpModes.

As shown, the current OpMode will NOT appear on the driver station's OpMode list because of the
``@Disabled`` annotation which has been included.
This line can simply be deleted , or commented out, to make the OpMode visible.



## ADVANCED Multi-Team App management:  Cloning the TeamCode Module

In some situations, you have multiple teams in your club and you want them to all share
a common code organization, with each being able to *see* the others code but each having
their own team module with their own code that they maintain themselves.

In this situation, you might wish to clone the TeamCode module, once for each of these teams.
Each of the clones would then appear along side each other in the Android Studio module list,
together with the FtcRobotController module (and the original TeamCode module).

Selective Team phones can then be programmed by selecting the desired Module from the pulldown list
prior to clicking to the green Run arrow.

Warning:  This is not for the inexperienced Software developer.
You will need to be comfortable with File manipulations and managing Android Studio Modules.
These changes are performed OUTSIDE of Android Studios, so close Android Studios before you do this.

Also.. Make a full project backup before you start this :)

To clone TeamCode, do the following:

Note: Some names start with "Team" and others start with "team".  This is intentional.

1)  Using your operating system file management tools, copy the whole "TeamCode"
    folder to a sibling folder with a corresponding new name, eg: "Team0417".

2)  In the new Team0417 folder, delete the TeamCode.iml file.

3)  the new Team0417 folder, rename the "src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode" folder
    to a matching name with a lowercase 'team' eg:  "team0417".

4)  In the new Team0417/src/main folder, edit the "AndroidManifest.xml" file, change the line that contains
    package="org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode"
    to be
    package="org.firstinspires.ftc.team0417"

5)  Add:    include ':Team0417' to the "/settings.gradle" file.

6)  Open up Android Studios and clean out any old files by using the menu to "Build/Clean Project""
